I just played with the beautiful library of http://www.generative-gestaltung.de and trying to learn a bit about P5.js since they used it.

Have this thought to incorporate font variable(this website is sourceful for fonts: https://v-fonts.com/licenses/trial feature through 
reading the scrollPos here(like this one: https://codepen.io/valyanggy/pen/PoKNyJK) 

What puzzled me was that I still don't quite understand what a text() does and what type of element that is considered or how do I write a 
text.style.setProperty(), it always says text.style is not defined.

At least I got some cute imgs:
